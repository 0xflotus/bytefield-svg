This will contain instructions on how to use `bytefield-svg`, including
the domain-specific language it provides.

== Language

Since the adoption of https://github.com/borkdude/sci[sci] as the
interpreter, the language in which you write diagram specifications is
nearly complete https://clojure.org[Clojure], with the omission of
host interop features and a few functions which would be dangerous in
a shared execution environment.

And here is an example of how to draw a box with a custom label function:

[source,clojure]
----
(draw-box (fn [left top width height]
            (draw-line left top (+ left width) (+ top height))
            (draw-line left (+ top height) (+ left width) top)))
----
